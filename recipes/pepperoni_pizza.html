    <p>Pepperoni pizza is an all-time favorite that combines a crispy, chewy crust with tangy tomato sauce, melted mozzarella cheese, and spicy, flavorful slices of pepperoni. This crowd-pleaser originated in the United States but draws inspiration from traditional Italian pizza-making. The bold pepperoni slices crisp up deliciously around the edges as they bake, infusing the pizza with a smoky depth of flavor. Whether homemade or ordered from your favorite pizzeria, pepperoni pizza is the perfect comfort food for any occasion.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ball of pizza dough (about 250-300g or enough for one 12-inch pizza)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120 ml) tomato pizza sauce</li>
        <li>200g (7 oz) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>100g (3.5 oz) pepperoni slices</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>Optional: dried oregano or chili flakes for extra flavor</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can reach (usually about 475-500°F or 250-260°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat.</li>
        <li>Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness, typically about 12 inches in diameter.</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled dough to a pizza peel or baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Arrange the pepperoni slices on top of the cheese, distributing them generously.</li>
        <li>Drizzle a little olive oil over the pizza and sprinkle optional dried oregano or chili flakes if you like.</li>
        <li>Carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or place the baking sheet in the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and crispy, and the cheese is bubbling and slightly browned.</li>
  <li>Remove the pizza from the oven, let it cool for a couple of minutes, slice, and serve hot.</li>
</ol>
