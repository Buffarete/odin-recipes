    <p>Lasagna is a hearty Italian casserole layered with rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese, tender pasta sheets, and plenty of melted cheese on top. This comforting dish is perfect for family dinners or special occasions, offering a wonderful combination of flavors and textures in every bite. Slow-cooked meat sauce infused with garlic, tomatoes, and herbs forms the savory base, while layers of pasta and creamy cheese bring the dish’s structure and indulgence. Baked until bubbly and golden, lasagna is the ultimate soul-warming Italian classic.</p>
