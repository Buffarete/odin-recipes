    <p>Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish known for its creamy texture and rich, comforting flavors. Traditionally, it’s made with simple ingredients like eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, pancetta or guanciale, black pepper, and spaghetti. The magic happens when the hot pasta is tossed with the beaten eggs and cheese, creating a silky sauce that lightly coats every strand without using any cream. The crispy bits of pancetta add a savory, smoky crunch, perfectly balancing the dish.</p>
    <p>This recipe is quick and straightforward, making it ideal for a delicious weeknight dinner. You start by cooking the spaghetti until al dente, while frying the pancetta to render its fat. Then, off the heat, you mix the pasta with the egg-cheese mixture and pancetta, stirring vigorously to avoid scrambling the eggs. The result is a luscious, indulgent plate of pasta with a delicate peppery kick that’s both satisfying and elegant in its simplicity.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>400g spaghetti</li>
        <li>150g pancetta or guanciale, diced</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>100g Pecorino Romano cheese, finely grated</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente according to the package instructions.</li>
        <li>While the pasta cooks, heat a pan over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta or guanciale and cook until crispy and golden. If using garlic, add it to the pan and remove before mixing.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, beat the eggs and mix in the grated Pecorino Romano cheese along with a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is cooked, reserve about a cup of the pasta water and then drain the spaghetti.</li>
        <li>Add the hot pasta to the pan with the pancetta (off the heat) and quickly toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, stirring vigorously to create a creamy sauce. Add reserved pasta water a little at a time if the sauce is too thick.</li>    
        <li>Adjust seasoning with more black pepper if desired, and serve immediately.</li>
